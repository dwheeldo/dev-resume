      <p>After more than 10 years in the e-learning industry, I recently took the leap to completely focus my career on front end development.</p>
      <p>Since then I've learned JavaScript from the ground up, sharpened my knowledge of web fundamentals, and started to find my way around Node.js and React.</p>
      <p>In my working life I've proven myself to be friendly, dedicated and reliable, with great communication skills.</p>
      <p>I've worked closely with lots of household names, including IBM, O2 and PepsiCo, and pride myself on my ability to build strong relations with colleagues and clients alike.</p>
      <p>With my extensive experience of working in a production environment, I feel I have a lot to offer, and I'd love the chance to learn from more experienced developers while contributing to exciting new projects.</p>
