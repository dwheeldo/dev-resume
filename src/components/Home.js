      <p>Hello, I'm David, from Brighton in the UK. Pleased to meet you, whoever you are.</p>
      <p>Right, a bit about me. I'm a front end developer, as the heading up there suggests. After more than 10 years in the e-learning industry, dabbling around the edges of 'proper' coding, at the start of 2019 I decided to focus on building beautiful, functional websites. The following May I got a job with the good folks at Wild Dog Design, where I've been doing just that ever since.</p>
      <p>I'm passionate about making nice looking websites, and particularly trying to make them as accessible as possible to everybody.</p>
